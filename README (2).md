Introduction

This repository contains a churn customer dataset, which is a collection of data related to customer churn in a business. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or cancel their subscriptions. The dataset is provided in a structured format and can be used for various purposes, such as analyzing customer behavior, predicting churn, and developing strategies to retain customers.

Dataset Details

The churn customer dataset consists of the following files:

churn.csv: This file is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format and contains the main data. Each row represents a customer, and the columns represent various attributes and features associated with the customer.

churn data set.ipynb: This is the main notebook of the project in which various modeling are done and according to the accuracy score and the confusion matrix the logistic regression is the best suitable model for the data which is providing the accuracy of 84 percentage

Usage

The dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:

Customer churn analysis: Analyzing the dataset can help identify patterns or factors that contribute to customer churn. By examining different customer attributes and their relationship with churn, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior and make informed decisions to reduce churn rates.

Predictive modeling: The churn customer dataset can be utilized to build predictive models that forecast the likelihood of a customer churning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained using the provided features as inputs and churn as the target variable, enabling businesses to proactively address potential churn cases.

Retention strategies: Understanding the dataset can aid in the development of effective retention strategies. By analyzing the characteristics of customers who have churned, businesses can identify areas for improvement and implement targeted actions to retain customers who exhibit similar traits.
